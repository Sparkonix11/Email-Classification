# FastAPI for the API
fastapi>=0.95.1
uvicorn>=0.22.0

# Pydantic (FastAPI dependency, ensure compatibility with your FastAPI version)
# Usually, if FastAPI is Pydantic v2 compatible, this is fine:
pydantic>=2.0.0

# Transformers for the classification model
# Your model's config.json specifies "transformers_version": "4.51.3"
transformers>=4.30.0

# PyTorch (CPU version by default for Docker on Hugging Face Spaces)
# Let pip choose a compatible version with transformers 4.51.3.
# PyTorch 2.x is generally expected.
torch>=2.0.0

# SpaCy for PII Masking
# Choose a version you've tested or a recent stable one.
# If you resolved build issues for 3.8.x, you can use that.
# Otherwise, 3.7.x is also robust.
spacy>=3.5.0
# The SpaCy model (e.g., xx_ent_wiki_sm) should be downloaded in the Dockerfile.

# For model weights loading (if you use .safetensors, which is likely with transformers 4.51.3)
safetensors

# Regex library (only if you are using the third-party 'regex' package;
# Python's built-in 're' module doesn't need to be listed)
# regex

# If your PII masking code directly uses numpy (less likely if encapsulated in SpaCy)
# numpy
